<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Experiment with failure forecasting in an industrial environment based on Kaggle dataset and problem statement:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/podsyp/production-quality



## Built With

* XGBoost
* TensorFlow/Keras
* Plotly


## Key takeaways
* Fixing bad data quality for one of the sensors might be the best way to improve prediction quality
* Even initial experiment provided valuable insights with single point of the production line being the key predictor for future failures
* Difference in granularity of X and y data proved to be the biggest data wrangling challenge
* RNNs provided better results than initial XGBoost model
* XGBoost with HPO should also provide better results in the future
