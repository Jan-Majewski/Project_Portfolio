<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Allegro is the leading online marketplace in Poland. The aim of the project is extracting key data from Allegro Automotive, which will be later used in analysis of car offer pricing.

First notebook is focused on scraping Allegro pages with beautiful soup, understanding the html code and extracting desired data. After storing data it will be analyzed in following notebook.

The aim of this notebook is to serve as a tutorial to data extraction from Allegro and can be easility used for any Automotive Allegro pages, just by changing link below. It can also be adjusted to any product category after edits to key parameter data described in 3.1


In the second part of this project, my aim is to explore data scrapped from Allegro. The data consists of offers for BMW cars. After initial feature exploration, I have build a simple regression model, which allows to interpret key features effect on offer price.

This notebook combines ETL, visualization and statistical approach to data exploration. All the steps conducted in this part can be used as a foundation for a more advanced Machine Learning project.
